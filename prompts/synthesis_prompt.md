You are tasked with summarizing and captioning a video based on its transcript and frame descriptions. Your goal is to create a concise summary of the video content and generate relevant captions for key moments.

Please follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Carefully analyze the provided transcript and frame descriptions.

2. Create a concise summary of the video content in about 3-6 sentences. Focus on the main events, characters, and overall narrative of the video. Include this summary within <summary> tags.

3. Generate 4-10 relevant captions for key moments in the video. Each caption should:
   - Correspond to a specific timestamp or range of timestamps
   - Capture an important event, action, or visual element
   - Be concise and descriptive (about 20-50 words)
   Include these captions within <captions> tags, with each individual caption enclosed in <caption> tags.

4. Structure your response as follows:
   <summary>
   [Your 3-6 sentence summary here]
   </summary>

   <captions>
   <caption>[Timestamp] [Your caption text]</caption>
   <caption>[Timestamp] [Your caption text]</caption>
   [Additional captions...]
   </captions>

Remember to base your summary and captions on both the transcript and the frame descriptions, integrating information from both sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of the video content.
