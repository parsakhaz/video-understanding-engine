export default `Describe this image in detail, focusing on:
1. The characters and their actions
2. The setting and environment
3. Any visible objects or props
4. The overall composition and lighting

Be objective and avoid making assumptions about:
- Character identities (unless clearly visible)
- Emotions or intentions
- Actions not clearly shown
- Relationships between characters

Use neutral language and focus on what is definitively visible in the frame.`
